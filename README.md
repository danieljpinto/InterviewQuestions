# Interview Questions
An open source solution with questions that you would expect any candidate worth hiring at a mid-level / senior role to be able to answer.

The solution provided here is not supposed to be a catch all for developers, but more a base check of competancy in a C# development. A pre-screen to see if someone is worth taking to the next step in an interview process.
For questions you may consider asking, consider using some of the ones inside [this great GitHub Repo](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions). I will potentially add some questions of my own into the wiki or readme as time goes on.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by forking this project and adding, removing and refactoring questions as you see fit.

For your PR to be merged, it must not include any web, xamarin or 'coding street' questions. The current questionaire is just for core c# coding practices.

If you want to add questions about a 'coding street' please add a new project into the solution and prefix it with InterviewQuestions (i.e: InterviewQuestions.Web.Mvc)
