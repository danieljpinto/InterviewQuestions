# Interview Questions
An open source solution with questions that you would expect any candidate worth hiring at a mid-level / senior role to be able to answer.

The solution provided here is not supposed to be a catch all for developers, but more a base check of competancy in a C# development - A pre-screen to see if someone is worth taking to the next step in an interview process. You should absolutely be questioning candidates before, during and after this test. As well as giving them a further test (or a forked version of this repo) with more questions that are specific to your companies set-up.
For questions you may consider asking, consider using some of the ones inside [this great GitHub Repo](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions). I will potentially add some questions of my own into the wiki or readme as time goes on.

This test should be taken on a PC with no iternet access. As candidates should not need to pull down any nuget packages and they should also already know the rules stated. If you do provide internet access for these questions, remember to check the browser history of the machine you gave access to. A candidate who has to google how to do asyncronous programming is will likely be a bad candidate. - Don't give them a machine with 0 internet history too, as you will not be able to identify if the candidate has cleared their browsing history. 

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by forking this project and adding, removing and refactoring questions as you see fit.

For your PR to be merged, it must not include any web, xamarin or 'coding street' questions. The current questionaire is just for core c# coding practices.

If you want to add questions about a 'coding street' please add a new project into the solution and prefix it with InterviewQuestions (i.e: InterviewQuestions.Web.Mvc)
